# nix-dev

CLI for managing FHS environments on nixOS

# Getting started

Ever wanted to just get something to run on nixOS, quick and dirty, without the hassle of doing it properly?

Now there's the nix-dev cli

Create an environment using `$ dev add -e test-environment some-package another package`

For example `$ dev add -e headers zlib`

Now you've got an environment named `headers` that includes the zlib binary, library and include files

You can enter it with `$ dev enter zlib` which will spawn your default shell
